Services Documentation

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This documentation will cover all of the SERVICES (Static Facories), FACTORIES, and CONSTANTS used in the Abacus project.  For this project, we have been using a "Factories as Objects" methodology.  What this means is that each Factory can be considered the same as a Java object.  The Services all work as a collection of global variables and methods.  Constants are self-explainitory.

1a) Color (colorFactory.js)

A Color is an available color for an Option. Once a new Color object is created, its members should not be modified - only accessed.

Member Variables:

name - The name to be displayed for the color.
hex - A hex value for the represented color.

public functions:
Getters: getID(), getName()
getHex() - Returns hex as a CSS friendly string

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1b) Option (optionFactory.js)

An Option is an available Option for a Part.  For example, if a Part is the backrest, then it's options would be carbon fiber, plastic, or upholstery.  Once a new Option object is created, its members should not be modified - only accessed.

Member Variables:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1f) Wheelchair (wheelchairFactory.js)

A Wheelchair is a design generated by the user.  When the user chooses a frame on the Frames page, a new Wheelchair object is created.  Given the chosen frame, the wheelchair creates two arrays to track chosen options, colors, and measureOptions.  The Wheelchair then sets these to their default values.  As the user modifies their design on the abacus page, the wheelchair object gets modified.  This class has various methods for modifying its values as well as getting aggregate results such as total weight and total price.  The Wheelchair object does not contain direct references to Frame, Part, Option, Color, and Measure objects - only their IDs.

Member variables:
frameID - the frameID of the chosen frame
title - A user given name for the wheelchair
parts - An array of {partID, optionID, colorID, sizeIndex}. Each array element represents a color, option and size selection for a part
measures - An array of {measureID, measureOptionIndex}. Each element represents a measurement selection
previewImageGenerator - A helper object used to render the configurator image
inCurOrder - A boolean value indicating whether the wheelchair is in the current order.

public functions:
Getters
getAll() - Returns all members variables except the previewImageGenerator. This is enough to reconstruct the wheelchair object later
getPart(pID) - Returns {partID, optionID, colorID} from parts where partID = pID
getPartByIndex(index) - Returns parts[index]
getOptionIDForPart(pID)- Returns optionID for part with partID = pID
getColorIDForPart(pID) - Returns colorID for part with partID = pID
getMeasure(mID) - Returns {measureID, measureOptionIndex] from measures where measureID = mID
getMeasureByIndex(index) - Returns measures[index]
getOptionIndexForMeasure(mID) - Returns measureOptionIndex for measure with measureId=mID
getPartDetails(pID, unitSys) - Returns the name of the part, selected option and color, weight(in given unitSys) and price for the part with pID
getMeasureDetails(mID, unitSys) - Returns name of the measure, the selected option(in unitSys), the eight, the price, and the selected option(in alt unitSys)
getPreviewImages(angle) - Returns an array of images in zRank order that create the preview image for the given angle orientation.
setOptionForPart(pID, oID) - Sets optionID to oID for part with partID pID.
SetColorForPart(pID, cID) - Sets colorID to cID for part with partID pID.
SetSizeForPart(pID, sizeIndex) - Sets sizeIndex for part with partID pID.
setOptionAndColorForPart(pID, oID, cID)
setOptionAndSizeForPart(pID, oID, sizeIndex)
SetOptionIndexForMeasure(mID, index)
toggleInOrder() - Toggles whether the wheelchair is in the current order.
getTotalWeight()
getTotalPrice()

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1i) lodash
A great library for direct array and object manipulation. specification is available at https://lodash.com/


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1j) error

This Factory exposes an object with constructors for various Error types
Useful for easily resolving what went wrong when an error is received.
For example, you can just do `err instanceof Errors.NotLoggedInError` to see if
the error was raised because the user wasnt logged in for some action

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1k) discount

This Factory creates a Discount object
An order can have multiple discount objects
When calculating the price of an order, discounts specify how much percent to take off of each orders SubTotal price

Some disounts can be used with other discounts. For those discounts, the 'isMultiDiscount' will be set to true
Other discounts cannot be used with other discounts. For these, 'isMultiDiscount' is false

public function:
isExpired()  -- return a boolean if the discount code has expired
allDetails()  -- return all values within the a discount instance



----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1g) PreviewImage (previewImageFactory.js)

A PreviewImage is a helper class used by Wheelchair to generate its preview image.  Unless you are modifying how the preview image array is generated, you should always just use Wheelchair.getPreviewImages()

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1h) Order (orderFactory.js)

An Order is an object that tracks what the user is ordering.  This object contains an array of fully-designed wheelchairs and some aggregate functions regarding them.  Some of these include calculating subtotal, tax, and shipping fee.  In addition, the Order tracks information about the User and the state of the database when it is ordered (since that is subject to change).

Orders also track their sent date, and if an Order doesn't have a sent date, it is considered "unsent".  Whenever the user visits the Cart page [MyDesigns], a new unsent order is created for them.  This Order is then used as the "cart" through the entire ordering process.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2a) FrameData (frameDataService.js)

This service generates and keeps track of all the Frames.  When FrameData is first created, it pulls all frame data from the database and creates all of the Frame, Part, Option, Color, and Measure objects.  Accessing these objects should be done through FrameData (unless you already have a reference to a lower object).  If you think of the frame data as a tree, FrameData is the root.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2b) User (userService.js)

This service keeps track of the current user's data as well as the user's designs and orders.  The User service will track data whether or not the user is logged in - but will save data to the database if the user is logged in.  Login status can be found by the isLoggedIn() method.  The user service provides login() and logout() methods.

The User service also keeps track of the "currently-being-edited" wheelchair and order (getCurEditWheelchair and getCurEditOrder).  These are used by Abacus and Order pages to track changes made to them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2c) Unit (unitService.js)

This service contains various enums and methods relating to units.  The UnitType enum contains IMPERIAL and METRIC.  The methods take a unit system and return an appropriate factor/string/etc.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2d) Angle (angleService.js)

This service contains various enums and methods relating to angles.  This is mostly used by the preview image generator.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2e) SyncJSON (syncJSONService.js)

This service provides a function that allows JSON files to be read syncronously rather than asyncronously.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2f) Drop (dropService.js)

This service allows control of the header dropdown from any controller.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3a) Cost (costConstant.js)

Constants relating to costs the user must pay, such as the shipping fee and taxes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3b) Bank (bankConstant.js)

Constants regarding banking information.
