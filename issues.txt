Abacus Issues

List any issues/future complications/questions here
If answered or resolved, please write in resolution - especially if it hasn't been implemented yet

Should 'Frames' display the base price and base weight?

Set this up - need to decide later

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the plan for checking out multiple wheelchairs?
-Only allow one
-Multiple orders (go through order process multiple times)
-Set up 'Order' and 'Invoice' to handle multiple
-What is TiArrow expecting from this?  Can they accept multiple?

Plan: Multiple chairs at once, all in one order.  TiArrow can handle it.
Need design decision for invoice and order

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Current Terms & Conditions are fake - we can't forget to replace them

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ability to order multiple of same wheelchair? (Add multiplier to cart rather than recreating many times)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stop users from manually switching pages via URL?
-Also what about 'back' and 'forward'?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How will the current cart system respond when the site is live?
-Is cartData.json unique per user?
-Can we turn the cart into a sharedVar to guarantee functionality (as well as improve load times)?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cart wheelchair images borrowed from frame page

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

frameData.json is only a single frame object - should it be an array of frames?
-If we change this, need to accomodate code around change (ie point abacus.frameData to correct frame in array)
